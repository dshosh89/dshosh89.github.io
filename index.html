          MERCADO DE SAN MIGUEL</h4>
        <div>   
        HOURS<br>
        Sun-Thurs: 10am-12am<br>

        Welcome to stop #1 on your Tour de Mercados! No trip to Madrid is complete without visiting the San Miguel market. Located next to Plaza Mayor, this one is a bit pricier and more touristy than the rest, but its lively atmosphere and 33 stalls of food do not disappoint. Built in the 19th century, Mercado de San Miguel is also the only market left in Madrid with its original iron structure still intact.
        </p></div>
      <div class='rightside'>
              <p>   
       This market can be tricky to navigate at first as it tends to get pretty packed. Recommendation: eat a light breakfast and head to Mercado de San Miguel around 11am to experience one of Madrid’s most iconic markets without the crowd. San Miguel is designed for grazing on the go, so before deciding on a large bowl of paella, take a few moments to wander through the stands. 

Start by ordering a cafe con leche at Café Negro and a pastry at Horno de San Onofre. If you’re feeling more in the mood for lunch, pop over to Daniel Sorlut for a glass of albariño and a plate of oysters, one of the things the market is most famous for. Lastly, you can’t leave without trying- or at least snapping a picture of- the banderillas (small skewers of olives, cucumbers, peppers and pickled onions). These are located right next to Mya Valdalos, and are not only delicious, but unique to Mercado de San Miguel! 

When you’re ready to head out, take the exit next to Mariscos Morris and make your way into the next neighborhood of Lavapies...

  MERCADO ANTÓN MARTÍN </h4>
  <div>
  HOURS<br>
        Mon-Fri: 9am- 9pm<br>

  Mercado Antón Martín has what many would describe as a more bohemian personality. It’s also one of the most traditional markets in the city, having first opened in 1941. From organic produce to clothing and wine, there’s nothing you can’t find among the market’s 63 stalls. 

It’s a great local hangout spot, and in contrast to the crowded city center, will definitely give you a feel for a typical afternoon in Madrid.

      <div class='rightside'>
       <p>   
         As you start wandering closer to Mercado Antón Martín, you’ll notice fewer tourists and a more laid back vibe. Similarly, entering the market will feel very different in comparison to the experience you just had at Mercado de San Miguel. This unpretentious local market is the real deal. You’ll find local madrileños with their friends and families here enjoying cañas (small beers) and patatas bravas. If you’re still full from earlier, start by checking out Donde Sánchez, which sells beautiful Spanish ceramics and other gifts, or walk through the rows of butcher shops. 
Remember the prices here will be much cheaper than at Mercado San Miguel, so before you head to the next market, make sure grab a few traditional bites:
-Cracked Málaga olives at Variantes Juanjo
-Hand-sliced Iberico ham at Romero
-Aged manchego at Quesería Antón Martín

        Neighborhood: Chueca <Br>
        <p>
          
  Next stop: five-story food heaven. This market is trendy and modern, offering a fun vibe and some incredible culinary creations. 

The first floor is a gourmet food market with a variety of fresh produce and regional products. The next few floors are a maze of creative tapas and sit-down restaurants, and the very top you can find one of the best rooftop terraces in Madrid.

      The neighborhood of Chueca has a big personality, and the energy of this market is a direct reflection of the area it’s in. Mercado de San Antón is more of a gourmet food court than a traditional mercado like the one you just came from, so there is a large variety of options outside of traditional Spanish tapas. 

After browsing through the first floor market, get ready to graze through the next few floors of food stands. Most of the tapas range from €1 - €12, so if you really want to take it all in, trying lots of the smaller ones is the way to go! You could start with  Andalucian-style calamari at La Imperial, choose from a wide variety of Basque pintxos at Puturrú de Foie, or try the popular cod tostas at La Casa del Bacalao. If you’re looking for some variety, you’ll also find great international stands offering Greek and Japanese cuisine. 

Before heading out, make sure to grab a glass of rioja and take in an amazing view from the 5th floor terrace!

        Neighborhood: Salamanca <Br>
        <p>
          Located in one of the wealthiest neighborhoods of Madrid, Mercado de la Paz offers a mix of traditional small restaurants, wine bars, and specialty food stands. The market is over 135 years old and one of the best spots in the area to try some of the more well-known Spanish dishes. Stall owners have been around for generations and always seem happy to share recommendations, giving it a friendly neighborhood feel.

          One of the first things you may notice when entering the neighborhood of Salamanca is that it feels a bit fancier than some of the other areas you explored earlier. The walk from Chueca to Salamanca will take you through some beautiful parks and shopping areas on Calle de Serrano if you feel like making a pit stop along the way! 

And while you might be getting full at this point on the Tour de Mercados, there’s just one thing you absolutely must save room for at Mercado de la Paz. Casa Dani is famous for their tortilla española (Spanish omelette), which is located inside the market. After you order a pincho de tortilla, take a walk through the charcuterie and cheese stalls, leaving some time to chat with the stall owners in case you want to grab any gourmet items to go.

          MERCADO DE VALLEHERMOSO</h4>
        <div>  
        HOURS
        Sun-Thurs: 10am-12am
          Fri-Sat: 10am-1am</div>
        Neighborhood: Chamberi <Br>
        <p>
          
    Last but not least: Mercado Vallehermoso. Tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the rest the city, you’ll be ending with a completely different experience than you started with. The market was built in the 1930s, but until relatively recently had been largely abandoned and forgotten. Since its reopening, this market has become a destination for some of Madrid’s top chefs to bring their culinary creations. 
  </p>    </div>
      <div class='rightside'>
        <p>       
       Walking  from Salamanca to Chamberi takes 30 minutes, so if you want to give your feet a break, you can easily hop on the metro line 4 (brown line) at Serrano station. 

Once you get to Mercado de Vallehermoso you’ll find everything from the traditional baker’s, and butcher’s stalls to restaurants, craft beer, and Spain’s only permanent farmer’s market. It’s the perfect mix of traditional and modern. In the Mercado de Productores (farmers market) all the producers are from Madrid, or less than 120 km away, and many of the products are handmade. If you’re looking for some good dinner options, try the Korean BBQ ribs at Kitchen 154 or the Peruvian fusion cuisine at Tripea. Or if you’re just looking for dessert, go to Graciana for some Argentinian alfajores. 

And that wraps up your day of exploring five of Madrid’s neighborhoods market by market! From here, line 2 (red line) is the best metro line to take you back to the center.
